## [Discover the benefits of Zeppelin Components through live demonstrations. Click here ][1]

**( i ) Our library is a beta version**, *we'll be working on more components. Stay tuned for news and updates on our social media!*

------------

### How it works?
Welcome to **Zeppelin Components,** a fully customizable **UI library** where you will find production-ready-to-use elements to design or develop your web.

### Required Technologies
- Typescript
- Styled Components
- React

Traditionally, components are distributed as `NPM packages`, which can be installed in a project to utilize them. However, this method of distribution limits customization options, as control over the component is limited to the props and parameters made available by the creator.

**At Zeppelin Labs, we believe in giving our users full control over the components** they use. That's why we have chosen a different approach. Instead of distributing our components as `NPM packages`, we make the code available in a simple, easy-to-use boilerplate. This way, you can attach the code to your project and customize it to your exact specifications, giving you complete control over its behavior and appearance.

However, we understand that this approach may have some limitations, including a manual and potentially difficult update process as we add more features. We are constantly working to improve our processes and make updates more seamless for our users. We value your feedback and suggestions on how we can continue to improve our services and make them even more user-friendly.

### Get Components easy and quickly

1. Identify the [desired component.](https://components.zeppelinlabs.io/components/button)
1. Use the button "Go to the code"
1. Download files from Github.

The files included in our component distribution are divided into two categories. The first type is the file containing the logic required for the component to function properly. The second type is the style file, which controls the appearance of the component.

Most of our components are self-contained, meaning they do not rely on external libraries. However, in certain instances, they may depend on another Zeppelin Component, the Styled Components theme, or the global style. This approach streamlines project administration and makes it easier to manage over time.
